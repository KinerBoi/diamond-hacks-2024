        <h1> Stuck not knowing where you are? In the middle of the ocean with no clue of where you are? </h1>
        <p>
           Fear not! Based on the position of the starts, you can calculate your exact location in
           the middle of nowhere!

           First, to figure out your lattitude, or how north or south you are, You first need to do two things.
           When you look at the sky, do you see the North Star? If you do, then grab a protractor that every ship should have, and measure the 
           the angle between the North Star and the Horizon straight across from you. If you can't find a protractor, 
           take a slight guess with the use of your finger measurements! A diagram of what youre estimated to do for help.

           If you cannot find the North Star, then that means that youre probably in the Southern Hemisphere. If that is the case, you should be 
           able to see the Southern Cross at night. If so, repeat the same steps as above, but instead of the North Star replace it with the Southern Cross. 
           For reference, the Southern Cross looks like this:

           Find the angle, and input it in here!



           P.S - The latitude is essentially the same as the angle! This is because both the North Star and the Southern Cross are almost right in line with
           the North and South Pole! As such when getting the angle, it tells your latitude. Just that when youre in the Southern Hemispehre, 
           the angle is notated as negative.

            Now, for the second part. You know know where you are in terms of North or South, but now its time to figure out how much East or West you are!
            Before a ship takes off, it's initial coordinates and the time of the local area are taken into account, through a clock. Now, with satelites, 
            people dont have an immediate need to jot down this information, but to be safe we shall do so with a clock, which shall record the time of wherever your vessal
            took off. we shall also take the initial coordinates of where the vessel took off for safekeeping.


            Now, based on the position of the Sun, you shall figure out the current time of wherever you are! If you have exact times, no need for the chart!

            If the Sun has set, record the time it takes after the sun set before it rises to know what time you are currently at in the night.

            Based on this, put the two times here: The time of where you are at right now, and the current time of where you first departed.
